This version of the Source SDK is meant only for compiling server plugins for
the engine that runs Might and Magic: Dark Messiah Multiplayer. An official SDK
is not available and will likely never be released.

This is a modified version of the Episode One SDK. Changes to it were reverse
engineered from the Dark Messiah engine and game binaries.
